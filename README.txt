Hello, this application was built by Henrique Calixto in order to attend to the first project
of the Full Stack Web Developer course at Udacity.com

The project's objective is to display a dynamically generated web page showing some movie posters,
 information and trailer.

 The project is composed by the following files:
 	1)media.py: this module is responsable for declaring the Movie class.
 	2)fresh_tomatoes.py: this module is responsable for the web page generation, it's main function is
 	the open_movies_page, that receive a liste of Movies as input and output a web page containing those movies.
 	3)entretainment_center.py: this file is responsable for importing the other modules, generating
 	the data structure, that represents the movies, and pass it to the open_movies_page function in the
 	fresh_tomatoes module that opens the web page.

 To run this application, save the three previous mentioned files on a folder of your preference,
 open the entretainment_center.py and run it. A web page should open on your favorite browser and
 a file "fresh_tomatoes.html" should be created on the folder you saved the other files.
